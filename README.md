# 🏥 Predictive Hospital Resource & Emergency Load Intelligence System

## PS 06 – Hackathon Problem Statement

### 🚨 Problem Overview

Hospitals often face **unexpected surges in emergency cases**, leading to:

* Sudden emergency influx
* ICU bed shortages
* Staff burnout
* Poor preparedness during outbreaks or peak seasons

Most hospitals react **after overload occurs**, rather than planning ahead.

---

## 🎯 Proposed Solution

We built an **AI-powered predictive intelligence system** that helps hospitals proactively plan resources by:

* 📈 Predicting **daily emergency admissions**
* 🏥 Estimating **ICU bed demand**
* 👩‍⚕️ Forecasting **staff workload surges**
* 📊 Supporting **staff allocation, bed management & emergency preparedness**

The system leverages:

* Historical hospital admission data
* Bed & ICU occupancy rates
* Temporal features (day, month, weekends)
* Seasonal and trend-based patterns

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Historical data is used to train a machine learning model
2. Features such as recent emergencies, occupancy rates, and calendar data are processed
3. The trained model predicts emergency load
4. ICU demand and staff workload are derived using intelligent rules
5. Results are presented through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**

---

## 🖥️ Application Features

* 🔹 Manual input for daily hospital conditions
* 🔹 CSV upload for batch predictions
* 🔹 Real-time emergency admission prediction
* 🔹 ICU demand estimation
* 🔹 Staff workload categorization (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
* 🔹 Visual trend analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Streamlit
* Jupyter Notebook
